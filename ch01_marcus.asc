Different to Design-Based Research 

Discussing about mediating variables

*  How do we define technologies = digital technologies are the focus not instructional methods
*  How to define your problem statement, what is the difference between problem, hypothesis, what are independent and dependent variables in TEL research
*  For evaluation we create technologies and these can be evaluated according to different approaches:

**  Can the system identify input to classify input in the right way: this is applicable for example in text analysis as also in video analysis and classification of input for feedback to students?
**  Is the feedback a system creates in the learning process efficient and effective for learning?
